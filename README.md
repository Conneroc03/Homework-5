## Work Day Scheduler
The work day scheduler is a simple web application that allows users to schedule their work day tasks using local storage. The application displays a list of time blocks from 9am to 5pm and the user can enter their task into each time block using the respective textarea. The hour blocks change background color depending on whether the hour has passed or is upcoming. Users can save their task by clicking the save button to local storage. Upon closing and reloading the web app the saved data is immediately presented.
